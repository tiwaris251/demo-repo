 * Functions and data structures for JIDs.
 *
 * \b NOTE: This API is not thread-safe.  Users MUST ensure all jid instances
 * related to a particular jw_jid_ctx are never accessed simultaneously by
 * multiple threads.  Simultaneous access to jids in separate jw_jid_ctx
 * contexts is ok.
 *
 * \b NOTE: All strings passed to JID functions must be null-terminated UTF8
 * strings, and all strings returned from them are null-terminated UTF8 strings.
 * Be aware strlen() will return the number of bytes a string contains, not
 * necessarily the number of characters.
 *
 * \b NOTE: All localparts passed to JID functions (apart from
 * jw_jid_escape_localpart) must be escaped.  All returned localparts (except
 * those from jw_jid_unescape_localpart) are escaped.
