/**

 * \brief
 * SASL mechanism types and functions.  A SASL mechanism is an implementation
 * specification for a particular authentication mechanism.  To perform the
 * authentication, a mechanism instance needs to be instantiated and have its
 * evaluate method called one or more times with appropriate data and a
 * completion callback, which will be called by the mechanism to indicate
 * the results of the authentication sequence.
