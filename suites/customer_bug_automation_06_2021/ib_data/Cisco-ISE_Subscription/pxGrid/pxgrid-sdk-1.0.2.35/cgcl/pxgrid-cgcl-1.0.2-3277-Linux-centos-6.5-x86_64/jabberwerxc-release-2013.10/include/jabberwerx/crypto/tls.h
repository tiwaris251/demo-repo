/**
 * Create a new TLS/SSL context.
 *
 * An SSL context is used to create bufferevents associated with a particular
 * jw_stream (\see jw_tls_filter_stream, \see jw_tls_socket_create). jw_stream
 * may have a single, usually socket, bufferevent that can be used as a base
 * for an SSL filter. The JabberWerxC TCP socket stream is an example of this
 * type of stream.
 *
 * Alternately a jw_stream may be an abstraction without an underlying
 * bufferevent. These types of streams (BOSH for example) control their own
 * TCP connections and would use one or more SSL socket bufferevent for actual I/O.
 * Each SSL filter or socket is a seperate "SSL session". A single SSL context
 * may be used to for multiple streams and each stream may have multiple
 * sessions.
 *
 * The stream is used during construction for its options hash table.
 * and cached for later use in other jw_tls functions. For instance the
 * jw_tls_filter_create function creates a TLS filter using the stream's
 * bufferevent. Stream may be closed or reopened by the context while
 * handling connection.
 *
 * Once the stream has successfully connected (with no errors or with
 * accepted validations errors) future connects will never validate certificates
 *
 * This function can generate the following errors (set when returning false):
 * \li \c JW_ERR_NO_MEMORY if the context could not be allocated.
 * \li \c JW_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED if TLS support is has not been compiled into
 * this distribution.
 * \li \c JW_ERR_INVALID_STATE if other errors occur.
 *
 * \invariant stream != NULL
 * \invariant ctx != NULL
 * \param[out] ctx The newly constructed context
 * \param[out] err The error information (provide NULL to ignore)
 * \retval bool true  on success, else false.

/**
 * Create a transport layer security bufferevent filter on the given stream
 * and start SSL handshake.
 *
 * This function creates a TLS enabled filter on the given stream. Only one
 * filter can be created per jw_stream.
 *
 * A connection attempt is started during construction per protocol:
 * A TLS context MUST only be created after &lt;proceed/&gt; has been received
 * during STARTTLS negotiation (rfc6120 5.4.2.3). The context will immediately
 * attempt TLS negotiation following rfc6120 5.4.3.1 with the exceptions of:
 *  3 - the initiating entity SHOULD send a certificate to the receiving entity
 *      - cert exchange is not supported.
 *  5 - cert validation. todo make sure supported libs follow spec.
 *
 * Buffer I/O is suspended until a successful connection. It is safe
 * to write to the stream during this time and no read events will be
 * triggered. Buffer events are deferred, ensuring correct event order is
 * preserved. On success the stream will be reopened and all subsequent stream
 * reads/writes will be decrypted/encrypted.
 *
 * On certificate validation failure an optional callback will be triggered
 * (\see jw_tls_proceed). Connection (completion of handshake) will continue
 * once jw_tls_proceed has been called (\see jw_tls_accept_cb).
 * Other failures will cause the stream to be closed with an appropriate error.
 *
 * This function takes an optional override acceptance callback. The override
 * exists so that a controller can easily replace a user supplied cb without
 * having to modify the stream's configuration. This mechanism allows the
 * controller to coordinate acceptance between sockets for instance.
