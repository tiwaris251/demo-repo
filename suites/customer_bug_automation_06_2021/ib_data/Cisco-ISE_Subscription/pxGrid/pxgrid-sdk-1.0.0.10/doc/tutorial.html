		<h2><a id="c0">Introduction</a></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Cisco Platform Exchange Grid (pxGrid) enables multivendor, cross-platform network system collaboration
			among parts of the IT infrastructure such as security monitoring and detection systems, network policy
			platforms, asset and configuration management, identity and access management platforms, and virtually
			any other IT operations platform. When business or operational needs arise, ecosystem partners use
			pxGrid to exchange contextual information with Cisco products that support pxGrid.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Cisco pxGrid provides a unified framework that enables ecosystem partners to integrate to pxGrid once,
			then share context either uni or bidirectionally with many platforms without the need to adopt
			platform-specific APIs. pxGrid is secure and customizable, enabling partners to share only what they
			want to share and consume only context relevant to their platform. Key features of pxGrid include:

			<ul style="text-align:justify;">
				<li>
					Ability to control what context is shared and with which platforms â€“ Because pxGrid is
					customizable, partners can "publish" only the specific contextual information they want
					to share and can control the partner platform that information gets shared with.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bidirectional context sharing - pxGrid enables platforms to both share or publish context
					as well as consume or "subscribe to" context from specific platforms. These features are
					orchestrated and secured by the pxGrid server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ability to share context data in native formats - Contextual information shared via pxGrid
					is done in each platform's native data format.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ability to connect to multiple platforms simultaneously - pxGrid enables platforms to publish
					only the context data relevant to partner platforms.  Numerous context "topics" may be customized
					for a variety of partner platforms, yet always shared via the same reusablepxGrid framework.
					Furthermore, only sharing relevant data enables both publishing and subscribing platforms to scale
					their context sharing by eliminating excess, irrelevant data.
				</li>
				<li>
					Integration with Cisco platforms - pxGrid provides a unified method of publishing or subscribing
					to relevant context with Cisco platforms that utilize pxGrid for 3rd party integrations.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			Currently client libraries are available for the C and Java programming languages. This document
			describes how to use the pxGrid Java client libraries. For reference, the
			<a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> is also available as part of this SDK distribution.
		</p>

		<h2><a id="c1">Prerequisites</a></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			This document is intended for developers and assumes:
			<ul style="width:550px;">
		   	    <li>You have an understanding of pxGrid concepts (see pxGrid Technical Overview)</li>
			   	<li>You have installed and set up ISE (see pxGrid Configuration Guide)</li>
				<li>You have unpackaged the SDK into a directory herein referred to as <SDK_HOME>
					and has successfully executed the sample scripts (see pxGrid Setup Guide)
				</li>
				<li>You have moderate experience with compiling and running Java programs</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>

		<h2><a id="c2">Programming Environment</a></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			As with any software programming project, you must first set up the programming environment with the
			appropriate dependencies. The details for this largely depend on the type of development tools
			being used. However, pxGrid provided its Java SDK as JAR files just like other Java-based systems.
			These need to be in your classpath for your code to compile. All libraries (including dependencies)
			are located in the directory &lt;SDK_HOME&gt;/lib. The SDK samples are located in separate 
			&lt;SDK_HOME&gt;/samples/lib. However, if you are writing code that doesn't depend on samples source you
			just need to include all JAR files in &lt;SDK_HOME&gt;/lib in your classpath.
		</p>

		<h2><a id="c3">Building a Sample Application</a></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			In this tutorial we will create a basic pxGrid client that retrieves session information in real-time from ISE.
			Whenever wireless devices connect to or disconnect from the network, ISE will publish session notifications
			through pxGrid. Our simple application will receive these notifications and print relevant session
			information to the console. Of course, a real-world applications will do more than just print session
			information. Having context from ISE, updated in real-time, applications can performance a virtually unlimited
			set of functions. However, we will keep things simple for the purpose of this tutorial. We will also show how
			to use other parts of the API such as querying for a specific session and downloading all active sessions
			at once. Having read the pxGrid Programming Guide, you are familiar with 

			<ul style="width:550px;">
				<li><a href="#a1">Configuring a pxGrid Connection</a></li>
				<li><a href="#a2">Connecting to the pxGrid Controller</a></li>
				<li><a href="#a3">Subscribing to Session Notifications</a></li>
				<li><a href="#a4">Querying for Specific Sessions</a></li>
				<li><a href="#a5">Downloading all Sessions in Bulk</a></li>
				<li><a href="#a6">Disconnecting from the pxGrid Controller</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3><a id="a1">Configuring a pxGrid Connection</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Before a pxGrid client can connect to the pxGrid Controller, a
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/TLSConfiguration.html">TLSConfiguration</a> object needs to be
			instantiated and set with the appropriate properties. Most properties are used to set up the following
			security mechanisms. In the next few paragraphs we describe security in general to give context around
			why pxGrid needs certain properties.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Internally, the pxGrid client library uses encryption at the transport layer
			(TLS with mutual authentication) in all communication with the pxGrid Controller. This requires a key
			store and a trust store. The key store contains the certificate/key pair that gets used during the
			TLS handshake between the pxGrid client and the pxGrid Controller. Currently the Java API only supports
			JKS key stores. You specify the key store location in the keystorePath property. You'll also need
			to set the keystorePassphrase property since key stores are password-protected. The trust store
			contains the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) that signed the pxGrid Controller certificate.
			If the CA certificate is part of a chain, be sure to add the entire chain to the trust store. Like
			with the key store, the trust store takes the form of a JKS file. You specify the trust store location
			in the truststorePath property.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			The property username is used to specify the name of the client trying to
			connect. This value must be unique for each client trying to connect. When you connect using a certain
			username for the first time, the certificate used in the TLS handshake is associated with the username
			on the pxGrid Controller. To connect again, the same certificate must be used. Otherwise authentication
			will fail.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			pxGrid uses group-based authorization. When a client connects for the first time, the client is
			associated with a group. Currently pxGrid supports the following groups: Basic, Session, and EPS.
			Clients in the Basic group can only connect and perform very basic functions. Clients in the Session
			group can perform everything in the Basic group along with other actions such as subscribing to session
			notifications, querying for session information, and downloading session information in bulk. Clients
			in the EPS group can perform everything allowed in the Session group along with other actions such as
			quarantining an IP address, unquarantining an IP address, etc. Note that by specifying the group
			property in the configuration, you are merely asking to register as a member of the group.
			Administrators have control over your group membership in the administration console. The following
			summarizes the groups and access:
		</p>

		<div style=" text-align: left; text-indent: 10px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 40px 0px 40px;">
			<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="background-color: #ffffff;">
				<tr valign="top">
					<td style="width: 200px; text-align:center; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px;"><b>Group</b></td>
					<td style="text-align:center; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px;"><b>Access</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr valign="top">
					<td style="border-width : 1px;">Basic</td>
					<td style="border-width : 1px;">connect only</td>
				</tr>
				<tr valign="top">
					<td style="border-width : 1px;">Session</td>
					<td style="border-width : 1px;">connect, consume session information</td>
				</tr>
				<tr valign="top">
					<td style="border-width : 1px;">EPS</td>
					<td style="border-width : 1px;">connect, consume session information, invoke EPS actions</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			For this tutorial, we specify Session as the group so we can later subscribe to session notifications.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Other properties unrelated to security are part of the TLSConfiguration. Hosts refers to the pxGrid Controller
			hostnames. In a simple setup, there will be only one host. In a high-availability environment, there will be
			an active and a standby host. Specify the active hostname first and the standby hostname second. Finally, you
			can set a description. Although optional, this property will associate a more verbose description of your
			client with your account for the administrator to see.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // configure the connection properties

    TLSConfiguration config = new TLSConfiguration();
    config.setHosts(new String[]{"ise.test_domain.com"});
    config.setUserName("test_client");
    config.setGroup(Group.SESSION.value());
    config.setKeystorePath("/root/testKeystore.jks");
    config.setKeystorePassphrase("test_password");
    config.setTruststorePath("/root/testTruststore.jks");
    config.setTruststorePassphrase("test_password");
			</pre>
		</div>

		<h3><a id="a2">Connecting to the pxGrid Controller</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Clients actually establish a connection with the pxGrid Controller by calling either the 'connect' method of the
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/GridConnection.html">GridConnection</a>
			class or using the
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/ReconnectionManager.html">ReconnectionManager</a> class. GridConnection.connect
			will establish the connection but won't provide fault tolerance. In the event the connection is broken, the
			client remains unconnected to the pxGrid Controller, unable to receive notifications, issue queries, or issue
			bulk download requests. For this reason we strongly recommend you use the ReconnectionManager. Like the
			GridConnection.connect, the ReconnectionManager will establish the connection but with the added benefit of
			fault tolerance. In the event the connection is broken, the ReconnectionManager will attempt to reconnect for you.
			The ReconnectionManager.setRetryMilliseconds method allows you to control the retry interval. Try to keep that
			value on the order of multiple seconds.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // establishing a connection with the pxGrid controller

    GridConnection con = new GridConnection(config);
    ReconnectionManager recon = new ReconnectionManager(con);
    recon.setRetryMillisecond(2000);
    recon.start();
			</pre>
		</div>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			If the client is connecting to the pxGrid Controller for the first time, an account is established on the pxGrid
			Controller. In pxGrid's auto-registration mode (set by administrator through the ISE web-based user interface),
			the client is allowed to communicate once the account is created. Whereas if auto registration mode is turned off,
			the node and authorization group assignment of the node remains in Pending Approval mode and not allowed to communicate
			over pxGrid until it is approved by the administrator.
		</p>

		<h3><a id="a3">Subscribing to Session Notifications</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			ISE receives session updates from devices as they connect, authenticate, and disconnect from the network.
			As a client to pxGrid, ISE publishes these updates to pxGrid so other clients can receive real-time
			notification of this network activity. You can receive these notifications by performing two steps.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			First, create a custom implementation of
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/identity/SessionDirectoryNotification.html">SessionDirectoryNotification</a>.
			There is only one method to be concerned with, called 'onChange'. This method will get called internally
			by the pxGrid client library when session updates are received from the pxGrid controller. For the
			purposes of demonstration, the implementation below simply prints out the GID of the session. Your
			real-world implementation will obviously do much more. Keep in mind that you will need to build thread
			safety into your implementation. You can expect that 'onChange' will get called by multiple threads
			at the same time. Take this into account when writing your code.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // creating a custom session notification handler

    public class SampleNotificationHandler
        implements SessionDirectoryNotification
    {
        @Override
        public void onChange(Session session) {
            System.out.println("received session: " + session.getGid());
        }
    }
			</pre>
		</div>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Second, create an instance of your handler and register the instance with your pxGrid connection using the
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/identity/SessionDirectoryFactory.html">SessionDirectoryFactory</a>
			class as follows.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // creating a custom session notification handler

    SampleNotificationHandler handler = new SampleNotificationHandler();
    SessionDirectoryFactory.registerNotification(con, handler);
			</pre>
		</div>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			A <a href="../samples/src/java/com/cisco/pxgrid/samples/ise/SessionSubscribe.java">complete example of session subscribe</a>
			is available. In addition to subscribing to session notifications, you can also subscribe to identity group notifications.
			The setup is similar to above. You can view the
			<a href="../samples/src/java/com/cisco/pxgrid/samples/ise/UserIdentityGroupSubscribe.java">complete example of identity
			group subscribe.</a>
		</p>

		<h3><a id="a4">Querying for Specific Sessions</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Perhaps there is a specific session you are interested in, and you only know a characteristic of the session such
			as an IP address. Through pxGrid, you can query ISE for the particular session. This and many other types of
			queries can be initiated using the 
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/identity/SessionDirectoryQuery.html">SessionDirectoryQuery</a>
			class. To retrieve a session by its IP address, provide the IP address the the getActiveSessionByIPAddress
			method as shown below.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // create query we'll use to make call

    SessionDirectoryQuery query = SessionDirectoryFactory.createQuery(con);
    InetAddress ip InetAddress.getByName("1.2.3.4");
    Session session = query.getActiveSessionByIPAddress(ip);
    System.out.println("received session: " + session.getGid());
			</pre>
		</div>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			A <a href="../samples/src/java/com/cisco/pxgrid/samples/ise/SessionQueryByIp.java">complete example of session query</a>
			is also available.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			As you can see from the API documentation for 
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/identity/SessionDirectoryQuery.html">SessionDirectoryQuery</a>,
			you can initiate a wide range of queries related to the session directory. In pxGrid terminology, these queries are
			all part of the Session Directory capability. Other capabilities are also supported. For example, pxGrid supports
			the Endpoint Protection Service (EPS) capability. Queries for the EPS capabilities are wrapped into the class
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/eps/EPSQuery.html">EPSQuery</a>
			for ease of use. Using the API you can, for example, quarantine an IP address. You can also find queries related
			to the Identity Group capability by using the <a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/identity/IdentityGroupQuery.html">IdentityGroupQuery</a>
			class. You can, for example, retrieve the identity groups associated with a user.
		<p>

		<h3><a id="a5">Downloading all Sessions in Bulk</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			While subscribing to session notifications will give you the updated session state, you may at times need to
			retrieve all active sessions in ISE. If your application requires all session state you may want to initiate
			a bulk download query when a connection to pxGrid is established. Once again, you can use the
			<a href="api/index.html?com/cisco/pxgrid/stub/identity/SessionDirectoryQuery.html">SessionDirectoryQuery</a>
			class for this purpose. A method called getSessionsByTime takes a time range in the form of two Calendar
			objects. The first specifies the beginning of the time interval, and the second specifies the end of the
			time interval. The example below uses a time interval of the last hour. Thus, the API returns all sessions
			active in the last hour.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // construct a date range and request those sessions

    Calendar begin = Calendar.getInstance();
    begin.set(Calendar.HOUR, begin.get(Calendar.HOUR) - 1);
    Calendar end = Calendar.getInstance();

    SessionDirectoryQuery query = SessionDirectoryFactory.createQuery(con);
    SessionIterator iterator = query.getSessionsByTime(begin, end);
    iterator.open();

    Session session = iterator.next();
    while (session != null) {
        System.out.println("received session: " + session.getGid());
        session = iterator.next();
    }
			</pre>
		</div>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
		   Keep in mind that your ISE server may have a large number of active sessions (perhaps hundreds of thousands). Whereas
		   a simple query by IP address may take a few milliseconds, the bulk session download may take a few minutes if the
		   number of sessions is large. So take caution in how you write your code to account for this (ensure nothing is
		   waiting on the operation that can timeout, etc).
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			A <a href="../samples/src/java/com/cisco/pxgrid/samples/ise/SessionDownload.java">complete example of session download</a>
			is also available. Another bulk download operation allows you to retrieve all identity groups associated with active
			users. Refer to the samples for code of this
			<a href="../samples/src/java/com/cisco/pxgrid/samples/ise/UserIdentityGroupDownload.java">identity group download</a>.
		</p>

		<h3><a id="a6">Disconnecting from the pxGrid Controller</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Previously you <a href="#a2">connected your client to the pxGrid Controller</a> by starting the reconnection manager. To disconnect
			from the pxGrid Controller, all you need to to is stop the reconnection manager. If we had subscribed to session
			notifications on this pxGrid connection, then our notification handler will stop receiving notifications once the
			connection is dropped.
		</p>

		<div>
			<pre class="prettyprint">

    // disconnect from xGrid. using the reconnection manager we only
    // need to call stop.

    recon.stop();
			</pre>
		</div>

		<h2><a id="c5">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Below is a list of common issues you may face when writing code to integrate with pxGrid.
		</p>

		<h3>Connection Errors</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">
					<b>After enabling pxGrid in ISE deployment, the pxGrid services UI page on ISE administrative node does not show any
					client or capability data.</b>
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">
					This error could occur if a connection could not be established between the ISE administrative node and pxGrid server.
					This can happen if the right certificates are not setup on the ISE administrative node for use for pxGrid connection.
					Make sure that on ISE administrative node, a system certificate to be used for pxGrid services is setup and also the
					corresponding CA certificate is set up in the trusted certificate that is trusted for authentication within ISE.
 		 		</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">
			   	   <b>Not able to establish connection from a pxGrid client node to pxGrid server due to
				   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_ failure</b>
				</p>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			Handshake failure can happen if the certificate presented by the client program is invalid or  not trusted by ISE.
        			Make sure that the certificate is not expired  and there is no timing issues between the pxGrid server and the pxGrid
        			client node.  Also ensure that the  right intermediate/root CA certificate that signed the client certificate exists
        			on the ISE server as Trusted Certificates.
        		</p>
			</li>
			<li>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			<b>Not able to establish connection from pxGrid client node to pxGrid server due to
        			"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException: root certificate not trusted of . . ."</b>
        		</p>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			This can happen if pxGrid server certificate is not trusted by the pxGrid client node. Make sure that the trust store
        			on the client contains the intermediate/root certificate of the certificate used by  pxGrid server.
        		</p>
			</li>
			<li>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			<b>Not able to establish connection from pxGrid client node to pxGrid server due to "SASL authentication
        			EXTERNAL failed: not-authorized:"</b>
        		</p>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			Make sure that the certificate presented by the the pxGrid client node is the same as was used for the first time
        			connection establishment. pxGrid internally stores the certificate fingerprint for each client. If the fingerprint does
        			not match, this error can be thrown. Also, make sure that the pxGrid client node is not in disabled state. This can be
        			checked from the ISE pxGrid services page on ISE administrator node.
        		</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Authorization Errors</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			<b>On subscribing to a capability or while invoking a query on a capability, a "Not Authorized" error is thrown by the
        			GCL library</b>
        		</p>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			This can happen if the pxGrid client node is not part of the right authorization group that provides access to a
        			capability. Please check authorization groups section to see the list of supported groups and access provided.
        			Authorization group for a pxGrid client node can be changed from ISE pxGrid services page on ISE administrator node.
        		</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Query Errors</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			<b>On invoking a query on a capability, "No provider for this capability is available" error is thrown by the GCL
        			library</b>
        		</p>
        		<p style="text-align:justify;">
        			This implies that there is no provider registered for this capability so pxGrid is not able to route the message.
        			You can check the provider for a capability from ISE pxGrid services page on ISE administrator node. Make sure that
        			the provider is online. For e.g. if you see this error on calling bulk download API or session query API,  it implies
        			that the ISE MnT node which is the provider for session data may be down or is not able to establish connection to
        			pxGrid server. If this error is seen for EndpointProtectionServiceCapability, please make sure that EPS Service is
        			enabled on ISE.
        		</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
