Usage: 	./BAT_MM <SSH IP> <LAN IP> [<RuleSet_File|NIOS>]

Example: 
	./BAT_MM 10.36.0.154 10.34.9.51 NIOS
	./BAT_MM 10.36.0.154 10.34.9.51 /import/qaddi/Olympic-Proj/ET_Rules/latest_et_rules_file.txt 

Prerequiste:
============
- Grid should be configured with TP service running
- Upload ruleset to the Grid before running the test
- Add "REA DNS" (10.39.16.160) as Forwarder and Enable Forwarder Only and Allow Recursion in Grid DNS Properties
- Enable remote console access on the Grid

What this script does (Script Algorithm):
