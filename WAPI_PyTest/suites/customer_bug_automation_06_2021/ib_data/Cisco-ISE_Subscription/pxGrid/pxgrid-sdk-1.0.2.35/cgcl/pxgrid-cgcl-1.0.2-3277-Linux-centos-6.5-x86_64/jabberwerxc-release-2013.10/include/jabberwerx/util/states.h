/**
 * \file
 * \brief
 * Functions and data structures for the state management engine.
 *
 * A states object manages the callbacks bound to specified events to ensure
 * only the specified callbacks are bound when this states object is in a
 * particular state.  For the purposes of this object, states are integers
 * between the values of 0 and the length of the "names" array parameter passed
 * into the constructor (max 255 states).
 *
 * The current implementation is not optimized for large numbers of registered
 * callbacks, but could be made so if the need arises.
